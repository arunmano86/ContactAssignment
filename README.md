In this Assignment, I would like to show how to implement MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern with using Dagger2 and also by Kotlin.

Design Patterns are very remarkable topic for mobile development. And as developers (not just android or mobile developers), we are trying to write cleaner and more testable codes and applications.

For the Android, with MVP, we are able to take most of logic out from the activities (or fragments). So that we can test it without using instrumentation tests. And with Dagger2, it is easier to apply concept of dependency injection.

So, this application will cover two design patterns: MVP and Dependency Injection. You may heard typicode, was used as server. It will be abstracted by using Retrofit and RxJava2 will be used to make requests it as observables which is another hot topic for mobile development.
